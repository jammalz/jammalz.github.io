                <li><p>The goal of the visualization is to highlight how the three pointers' importance have changed over the years and how Stephen Curry is really above average in statistics related to three pointers.</p></li>
                <li><p>The animated version of this visualization goes slide by slide by presenting useful information about 4 of the most outstanding three-point shooters in the history of the NBA: Larry Bird in the 80's, Mitch Richmond in the 90's, Ray Allen in the 00's and finally Stephen Curry since 2010. The main goal is to show how not only he is above average even if compared to the other stars, but also how the nba average has grown so much faster since he made the three-pointers much more popular.</p></li>
                <li><p>This visualization is of many present in our webpage. Check our work to see the animated version of this animation and get to know more about how Stephen Curry changed the history of NBA with his outstanding three-pointer shooting skills.</p></li>
