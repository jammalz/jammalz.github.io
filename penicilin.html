                <li><p>The goal of the visualization is to educate the audience about the ineffectiveness of Penicilin agains gram-positive bacteria. The project uses Tableau to build the visualization.</p></li>
                <li><p>Considering the comparison of the effectiveness of the different antibiotics to gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria as the main goal, a bar chart was the best way to draw this comparison to the audience. The main communication goal is to show how penicillin is ineffective against gram-negative bacteria when compared to the other antibiotics analyzed.</p></li>
                <li><p>The bacteria are in the x axis and the IMC concentrations are in the Y axis to make the names of the bacteria easier to read to the audience. Bacteria were split in the sorting between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria so the differences in the trends that were trying to be highlighted were clearer to the user. Also, using the logarithmical scale for the IMC concentrations was the best way to allow clear visualization of all bars in the graph.</p></li>
                <li><p>The description in the top makes a concise explanation of what the axis mean and what the values mean in practical terms. The highlight in the impact phrase makes sure that the audience will take that message into consideration before making any misleading conclusions about the results shown in the table. The arrow also draws attention to the part of the data most related to the main goal of the visualization, the ineffectiveness of Penicillin against gram-negative bacteria.</p>
